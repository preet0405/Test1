This html file demonstrates the project of grade activities.
The user needs to enter activity name, weightage, grade and other such important fields.
The system enters and updates the data as per the user inputs.
I have taken help from chatgpt for activity counter function.
It also shows error messages when the user enters inappropriate data which reciprocates the requirements.
For better visuals I have added colour and a little bit of styling to the webpage which appeals the user's sight.
Thank You!
